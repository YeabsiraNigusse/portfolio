    <h2>About my university</h2>

    <p style="padding: 1rem;margin-left:1px;font-family: calibri;">The origins of AAU was a two-year college in 1950 by the Jesuit Lucien Matte, at the appeal of His Majesty Emperor Haile Selassie I.
    [3] It began operations the following year. 
    Over the following two years an affiliation with the University of London, and University of Oxford was developed. 
    Africans from various parts of the continent would receive free scholarships through programs subsidized by the Organisation of African Unity for higher learning. 
    AAU was also known for sending its students abroad for an extended interpersonal educational experience, and having those students return with the exemplary standards of the international community.
    The nucleus of AAU was formed with the establishment of the University College of Addis Ababa (UCAA) in 1950.
    [4] UCAA, which initially consisted of the Faculties of Arts and Science, became a fully fledged college when it was chartered in 1954. 
    In 1955, the Building College was opened.
     In February 1961, these various colleges and the Theological College were brought together to form the Haile Selassie University.
      <br>Emperor Haile Selassie I gave his Guenete Leul Palace to serve as the administration building and main campus.
       He had abandoned the palace, where a number of his ministers and favorites were killed in the wake of the abortive Coup d'Ã©tat in 1960, in favor of the new Jubilee Palace.[5] Following the 1974 revolution,
        the university was briefly renamed University of Ethiopia (National University) before it came to assume its present designation, AAU, in 1975.
       [6] In the wake of the revolution, AAU was closed for two years and students and staff were drafted into what was known as the Development through Cooperation Campaign (zemecha), designed to arise the 
       awareness of the rural population in the spirit of the revolution.
       [7] The university offered its first Master's programs in 1979 and its first PhD programs in 1987.[8] </p>
    <p style="padding: 1rem;font-family: calibri;">Addis Ababa University (AAU), which was established in 1950 as the University College of Addis Ababa (UCAA), is the oldest and the largest higher learning and research institution in Ethiopia.
         Since its inception, the University has been the leading center in teaching-learning, research and community services. Beginning with enrollment capacity of 33 students in 1950, AAU now has
          48,673 students (33,940 undergraduate, 13,000 graduate and 1733 PhD students) and 6043 staff (2,408 academics and 3,635 support staff). In its 14 campuses, the University runs 70 undergraduate
           and 293 graduate programs (72 PhD and 221 Masters), and various specializations in Health Sciences. Over 222,000 students have graduated from AAU since its establishment. The University is led by a 
           President who is assisted by four Vice Presidents and one Executive Director: Academic Vice President, Vice President for Research and Technology Transfer, Vice President for Administration and Student
            Services, Vice President for Institutional Development and the Executive Director of the College of Health Sciences (with the rank of Vice President).</p>
